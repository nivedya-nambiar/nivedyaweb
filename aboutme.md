title: About me
---

Hi, I'm Nivedya. I enjoy science, music and literature. I recently graduated with a Bachelor's in Electrical Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, where I was fortunate to discover neuroscience in its interdisciplinary glory, and have my interests piqued by the wonderful, elusive human brain.
<br/>
I am currently a junior research assistant at the cognition lab at the Indian Institute of Science Bangalore. In a nutshell, my current work involves fMRI data collection and analysis for a simple experiment I designed to decode stimulus properties from the fMRI data. I largely work with MATLAB and Python for my project at the lab, and use simple machine learning and statistical frameworks performing decoding on imaging data.
<br/>
My research interests currently span perception, memory and learning as understood from a systems neuroscience perspective, employing computational methods. I am especially interested in auditory neuroscience and am intrigued by how the brain perceives music, eventually developing an individualistic sense of taste in music. :D
<br/>
When I'm not working, I enjoy listening to music with genres varying from classical to rock to jazz (need I mention, I enjoy K-pop albeit the fact that I can't lip sync most of the time). I love writing prose and occasionally poetry, when the weather is right. I have loved reading as a kid, and at the moment I am an adult that longs for days when reading was all there was to be done. Ciao!
