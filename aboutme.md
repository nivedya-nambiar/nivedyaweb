title: About me
---

Hi, I'm Nivedya. I enjoy science, music and literature. I recently graduated with a Bachelor's in Electrical Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, where I was fortunate to discover neuroscience in its interdisciplinary glory, and have my interests piqued by the wonderful, elusive human brain.
<br/>
I'm currently a student at EPFL, doing a master's in Neuro-X (while the title sounded a bit off-putting to even me at first, the X implies an amalgamation of computational neuroscience, neurotechnology and neuroAI in the coursework and projects and maybe even a hint at all that we don't know about neuroscience - yet).
<br/>
I worked as a junior research assistant at the cognition lab at the Indian Institute of Science Bangalore from June to December of 2023. In a nutshell, my current work involved fMRI data collection and analysis for a simple experiment I designed to decode stimulus properties from the fMRI data. I largely worked with MATLAB and Python for my project at the lab, and used simple machine learning and statistical frameworks performing decoding on imaging data.
<br/>
My research interests currently relate to the computational modelling of neuropsychiatric disorders from a systems neuroscience perspective. I am also interested in auditory and linguistic neuroscience and am intrigued by how the brain perceives music, eventually developing an individualistic sense of taste in music. :D
<br/>
When I'm not working, I enjoy listening to music with genres varying from classical to rock to jazz (need I mention, I enjoy K-pop albeit the fact that I can't lip sync most of the time). I love writing prose and occasionally poetry, when the weather is right. I have loved reading as a kid, and at the moment I am an adult that longs for days when reading was all there was to be done. Ciao!
